# Bomb-Game
A player is standing in the corner of a 10x10 grid. They must move to the diagonally opposite square. The problem, the grid is seeded with a random number of "bombs". If they step on a bomb the game is over.

## Start-Up
Running the script should prompt a menu in the console. Use the numbers to select an option
Controls are WASD by default but can be swapped to UDLR (Up, Down, Left, Right) in the settings.

## Basic Mechanics
Navigate the board to reach the bottom right corner without hitting the bombs to earn coins
Coins can be used for customization

## Customization
Everything on the board can be customized
Head to the shop menu and purchase any of the characters that will be used to represent bombs, map background or the player using "buy item"

This was done as an assignment for my computer science class. I intend to add some more features in the future
